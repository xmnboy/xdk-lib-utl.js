`xdk-lib-utl.js`
----------------

This JavaScript library is a collection of utility functions designed for 
use in a Cordova webview app and can be used to help with debug and 
information to supplement your Intel XDK Cordova app development. You can 
take or leave whatever works for you, there is no need to use or keep
every function in this library.

Make sure you reference the `xdk-lib-utl.js` file before you use any of the
functions defined within, and place after the `cordova.js` script has run.
